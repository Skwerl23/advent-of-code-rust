# advent-of-code-rust
I have decided to solve as many advent-of-code challenges as I can in Rust.
I am learning this wonderfully difficult language. And what better way than to perform challenges.
Might as well share to git too.

# How to run
compile with cargo run. or your own compiler of choice.

it will ask you what year, and example is 15 or 21  (depending on what i've completed)
then it asks you the day. for example 03 or 15 (still depending on what i've completed)

The main function uses a match statement to determine what mod to run based on your input. 
It also uses use std::time::Instant to run a performance timer on the code you run.
